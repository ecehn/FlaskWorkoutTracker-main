To create a method to view workouts after inserting them, you'll need to define a new route in your Flask application. This route will retrieve the workout data from the database and render it in a view page.

Here's how you can implement it:

Define a new route in your workouts.py blueprint to handle requests for viewing workouts.
Inside the route function, retrieve the workout data from the database using your database logic.
Pass the retrieved workout data to a template for rendering.
Create an HTML template to display the workout data in a user-friendly format.
Here's an example implementation:

python
Copy code
# In workouts.py

from flask import Blueprint, render_template

# Assume you have a function to retrieve all workouts from the database
# Replace `get_all_workouts` with your actual database logic
from database import get_all_workouts

bp = Blueprint('workouts', __name__)

@bp.route('/workouts', methods=['GET'])
def view_workouts():
    # Retrieve all workouts from the database
    workouts = get_all_workouts()

    # Render the template with the workout data
    return render_template('view_workouts.html', workouts=workouts)
In this example:

We define a new route /workouts to handle GET requests for viewing workouts.
Inside the route function, we retrieve all workouts from the database using the get_all_workouts function (replace this with your actual database logic).
We pass the retrieved workout data to a template called view_workouts.html using the render_template function.
Now, you need to create an HTML template (view_workouts.html) to display the workout data. Here's a basic example:

html
Copy code
<!-- view_workouts.html -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>View Workouts</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Workouts</h1>
    <ul>
        {% for workout in workouts %}
            <li>{{ workout.exercise }} - Reps: {{ workout.reps }}, Sets: {{ workout.sets }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
